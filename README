Space Shooter by Vedilion.

A Java based multiplayer game based on Space invader, Raptor and other related games.

- The game really needs a name right now, which will help give the game a direction.


-- Getting started with the game --
The newest builds can be found in the "Builds" folder on github.
Unpack the two .jar files in the downloaded .rar file.

1. To start a server, just open the xxxx-xx-xx_game_server.jar, and you'r ready.
If you want people to connect over the internet, make sure your por t 9090 is open.

2. To start a "singleplayer" game, you still have to start a multiplayer server as above.
Then you open the xxxx-xx-xx_game_client.jar file. The server field is already pre-filled with "localhost",, so you don't have to do anything here.
In the Username field, you type in the username you want to use.
When you click the login button, you will see stars moving. Do any action to join the game now.

3. Joining a multiplayer game is almost like step 2. Only exception is that the "localhost" should instead be the IP of the computer running the server.
